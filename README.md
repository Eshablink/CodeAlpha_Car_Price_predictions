Overview
Predicting the price of a used car is a challenging task, as it depends on multiple factors such as:

Brand goodwill
Car's features
Driven distance
Fuel type
Year of manufacturing
This project aims to address these challenges by creating an end-to-end pipeline for car price prediction using Python and machine learning techniques.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes details about cars, such as:

Manufacturing year
Selling price
Present price
Driven kilometers
Fuel type
Transmission type
Number of previous owners
Source: [Mention the source of your dataset if available, e.g., Kaggle or internal].

Columns in the Dataset
Car_Name: Name of the car
Year: Year of manufacture
Selling_Price: Price at which the car is being sold (target variable)
Present_Price: Current price of the car
Driven_kms: Distance driven (in km)
Fuel_Type: Type of fuel used (e.g., Petrol, Diesel)
Selling_type: Whether sold by dealer or individual
Transmission: Transmission type (Manual/Automatic)
Owner: Number of previous owners
Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Visualization: Correlation heatmaps, boxplots, and distribution plots.
Feature Importance Analysis: Identifying the most influential features using Random Forest.
Model Training:
Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting
Model Evaluation: Using RMSE, MAE, and R² metrics.
Dependencies
To run the project, install the following Python libraries:


pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn


How to Run
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Car_Price_Prediction.git
cd Car_Price_Prediction
Open the Jupyter Notebook:


jupyter notebook Car_Price_Model.ipynb
Execute the cells in the notebook step-by-step to:

Preprocess data
Visualize insights
Train and evaluate machine learning models
For custom testing, replace the dataset file with your own data and update the preprocessing steps accordingly.

Results
The model delivers competitive results using the following techniques:

Model	RMSE	R² Score
Linear Regression	1.234	0.912
Random Forest	0.876	0.958
Gradient Boosting	0.842	0.962
Visualizations of predictions vs actual values demonstrate the model's accuracy.
